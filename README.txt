Package shuffler shuffles items.

# Why

Shuffled items can be anchored by position or relationship to other items.
This is very useful for market researchers doing surveys but may be useful to others.

# How

Here is a complete example, also found in the example directory:

.pull example/example.go,code

# When

Though I have not seen other implementations of shufflers with anchoring, I imagine they've been around for a while.
I have written several implementations over the years in various languages.
